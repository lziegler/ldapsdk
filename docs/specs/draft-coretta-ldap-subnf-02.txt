1.  Introduction

   Over the years, there have been instances where certain directory 
   implementations mistakenly apply DIT structure rule governance to
   [RFC3672] subentries beyond that which is permitted per ITU-T Rec. 
   [X.501].

   Clause 14.2 of ITU-T Rec. [X.501] states:

      Although subentry and subentryNameForm are specified using the
      notation of clause 13, subentries are not regulated by DIT
      structure or DIT content rules.

   Clause 14.2.2 of the same document states:

      No other name form shall be used for subentries.

   However, in implementations which do not recognize or incorporate
   this standard name form, attempts to create or relocate subentries
   can fail due to a naming violation (64) wrongly being perceived by
   the governing structure rule.  This has resulted in individuals
   making an assumption that manual creation of such subentry-focused
   name forms is an expected and required procedure.

   Under a strict interpretation of ITU-T Rec. [X.501], such behavior
   is considered erroneous.  It should not be necessary for individuals
   to create their own incarnation of the name form cited in Section 2,
   nor is it appropriate to deviate from the established naming policy
   for subentries.

   Unfortunately, this issue has prevailed for such a protracted period
   of time that it has gradually become a routine, but unsanctioned,
   procedure for those implementations that do not honor this mandate.

   This I-D seeks to mitigate this issue by formally describing the
   ITU-T Rec. [X.501] 'subentryNameForm' definition, per clause 14.2.2.

   Furthermore, this I-D reiterates that directory systems in which the
   creation of properly named subentries, as described in Section 2, is
   prevented by DIT structure rule governance is NOT TO BE REGARDED AS
   FULLY COMPLIANT in the context of ITU-T Rec. [X.501] clauses 14.2 and
   14.2.2.
 
   Additionally, this I-D emphasizes that directory systems which allow
   for the creation of subentry-focused name forms beyond that which is
   described in Section 2 are also similarly NON-COMPLIANT.

1.1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
   in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in
   all capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Acronyms Used

      ASN.1  Abstract Syntax Notation one
      DIT    Directory Information Tree
      LDAP   Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
      RDN    Relative Distinguished Name

1.3.  About Name Forms and DIT Structure Rules

   Name form definition per clause 13.1.8 of [X.501]:

      A name form specifies a permissible RDN for entries of a
      particular structural object class.  A name form identifies a
      named object class and one or more attribute types to be used
      for naming (i.e., for the RDN).  Name forms are primitive pieces
      of specification used in the definition of DIT structure rules.

   DIT structure rule definition per clause 13.1.6 of [X.501]:

      DIT structure rule: A rule governing the structure of the DIT by
      specifying a permitted superior to subordinate entry relationship.
      A structure rule relates a name form, and therefore a structural
      object class, to superior structure rules. This permits entries
      of the structural object class identified by the name form to
      exist in the DIT as subordinates to entries governed by the
      indicated superior structure rules.

   See Section 4.1.7.1 of [RFC4512] for descriptions of DIT structure
   rules.  See Section 4.1.7.2 of [RFC4512] for descriptions of name
   forms.

2.  'subentryNameForm'

   The 'subentryNameForm' name form definition manifests as follows:

Coretta                 Expires March 29, 2025                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft        The LDAP Subentry Name Form         September 2024


      ( 2.5.15.16
          NAME 'subentryNameForm'
          DESC 'X.501, cl. 14.2.2: the Subentry name form'
          OC subentry
          MUST cn )

   The name form bears the STRUCTURAL 'subentry' class reference as its
   OC clause value, meaning that entries residing in the administrative
   area of the relevant structure rule AND which bear the 'subentry'
   STRUCTURAL class shall be subject to naming enforcement.

   Furthermore, in observance of this name form, the 'cn' attribute type
   defined within Section 2.3 of [RFC4519] that is REQUIRED under all
   circumstances by the 'subentry' class is also REQUIRED for use as the
   principal RDN type.  No other RDN attribute type will suffice.

   For implementation reference, the ITU-T Rec. [X.501] ASN.1 equivalent
   to the above definition is as follows:

      subentryNameForm NAME-FORM ::= {
        NAMES            subentry
        WITH ATTRIBUTES  {commonName}
        ID               id-nf-subentryNameForm }

3.  Compliance Considerations

   First and foremost, the solution for this problem is to simply use
   the above 'subentryNameForm' definition as an integrated component
   of the directory product in question.  To be clear, this is the ONLY
   case in which a subentry-focused name form should EVER be integrated
   in this fashion.

   Unfortunately, the ramifications of this change may be negative if
   not implemented in a sensible manner.  This section covers various
   actions that may be taken in that regard.

   Should the issue be FULLY resolved in an abrupt manner, in that the
   directory service no longer honors the use of any subentry-focused
   name forms OTHER THAN that described in Section 2, and WITHOUT any
   notice being given to users, the risk of errors in implementations
   of the affected product will increase.  As such, this would almost
   certainly lead to a spike in support calls and trouble tickets for
   directory product vendors and maintainers.  This is undesirable.

   Conversely, the choice NOT to fix this issue -- while it does have
   the virtue of being the least disruptive option -- may harm or sully
   common impressions of the affected product in terms of questionable
   or incomplete standards compliance.

   Therefore, it is the opinion of this author that the BEST solution
   is to allow this behavior to be OPTIONAL, or user-elected.  In this
   case, the "option" to control this behavior SHOULD favor the current
   or "broken" state by default, so as to not introduce any change in
   behavior until such time that it is deemed appropriate.

   Not only would this method prove to be as non-disruptive as a choice
   to take NO action, but it would also allow for maintainers to devise
   the remainder of a mitigation plan in due course, allowing for ample
   testing, as well as user input on the matter, if deemed appropriate.

   Though NOT RECOMMENDED, this method also has the virtue of being more
   favorable to users who MAY wish to purposely forego compliance for
   some reason.

   Beyond the modification of directory service behavior as it relates
   to the interaction of DIT structure rules and subentries, maintainers
   SHOULD augment the underlying schema subsystem or parser to ensure
   that ANY attempt to introduce a subentry-focused name form -- OTHER
   THAN that defined in Section 2 -- will be ignored. 

   It is also RECOMMENDED that in the event such a name form is added, a
   warning should be raised to inform administrators of this condition.
