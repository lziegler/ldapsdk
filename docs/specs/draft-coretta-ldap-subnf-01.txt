1.  Introduction

   Directory implementations which actively enforce any number of DIT
   structure rules while also managing subentries as described within
   Section 2.4 of [RFC3672], perhaps as collections for [RFC3671]
   collective types, may trigger naming violations following an attempt
   to create additional subentries.

   This I-D seeks to mitigate this difficulty by extending a general-use
   name form definition which can be employed by way of the schema to
   extend the naming policy enforced by a DIT structure rule to include
   subentries.

1.1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
   in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in
   all capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Acronyms Used

      DIT    Directory Information Tree
      LDAP   Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
      RDN    Relative Distinguished Name
      OID    ASN.1 Object Identifier

1.3.  Allocations

   The following OID ancestry is relevant to this I-D:

     - 1.3.6.1.4.1.56521                           ; author root
     - 1.3.6.1.4.1.56521.9 (general-use)
     - 1.3.6.1.4.1.56521.9.4 (directory-services)
     - 1.3.6.1.4.1.56521.9.4.8 (schema)
     - 1.3.6.1.4.1.56521.9.4.8.6 (nameForms)

   Should this I-D be elevated to RFC status, the leaf node assigned to
   the name form definition in Section 2 shall be made OBSOLETE in favor
   of an IANA-assigned OID, at which point this I-D will be updated to
   only reference the literal 'IANA-ASSIGNED-OID' placeholder prefix,
   where appropriate.

1.4.  About Name Forms and DIT Structure Rules

   A name form schema definition, as described within Section 4.1.7.2 of
   [RFC4512], is used to declare a constraint to be applied to the RDN
   of new or relocated entries within a DIT which bear the STRUCTURAL
   class noted in the name form's OC clause.

   Name form definition per clause 13.1.8 of [X.501]:

      A name form specifies a permissible RDN for entries of a
      particular structural object class.  A name form identifies a
      named object class and one or more attribute types to be used
      for naming (i.e., for the RDN).  Name forms are primitive pieces
      of specification used in the definition of DIT structure rules.

   A DIT structure rule schema definition, as described within Section
   4.1.7.1 of [RFC4512], enforces the name form specified in its FORM
   clause upon qualifying entries within the relevant DIT branch or
   subschema administration point.

   DIT structure rule definition per clause 13.1.6 of [X.501]:

      A rule governing the structure of the DIT by specifying a
      permitted superior to subordinate entry relationship.  A
      structure rule relates a name form, and therefore a structural
      object class, to superior structure rules. This permits entries
      of the structural object class identified by the name form to
      exist in the DIT as subordinates to entries governed by the
      indicated superior structure rules.

2.  'subentryForm'

   The 'subentryForm' name form definition manifests as follows:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.56521.9.4.8.6.1
          NAME 'subentryForm'
          OC subentry
          MUST cn )

   The name form bears the STRUCTURAL 'subentry' class reference as its
   OC clause value, meaning that entries bearing this class shall be
   subject to naming enforcement by a referencing DIT structure rule.

   Furthermore, the 'cn' attribute type defined within Section 2.3 of
   [RFC4519] that is REQUIRED under all circumstances by the 'subentry'
   class is now also REQUIRED for use as the principal RDN type.

Internet-Draft        The LDAP Subentry Name Form         September 2024


   As a simple example, consider this hypothetical structure rule:

      ( 242
          NAME 'subentryStructure'
          FORM subentryForm
          SUP ( 0 1 ) )

    This hypothetical rule states that any entries that are presently
    being governed by superior structure rules zero (0) OR one (1) may
    allow the creation of subordinate 'subentry' entries.

    Please note that the nature of DIT structure rules allows for
    significant variations in composition and design across differing
    directory tree structures and, thus, the above example rule may
    not effectively support all use-cases as-is.

3.  IANA Considerations

   There are no requests to IANA in this document at this time.

4.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations applicable to this I-D.
