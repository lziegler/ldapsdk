/**
 * This class provides a request control which may be included in a search
 * request to indicate that the server should provide the number of entries that
 * match the search criteria.  The count will be included in the search result
 * done message, and all search result entries will be suppressed.
 * <BR>
 * <BLOCKQUOTE>
 *   <B>NOTE:</B>  This class, and other classes within the
 *   {@code com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.unboundidds} package structure, are only
 *   supported for use against Ping Identity, UnboundID, and
 *   Nokia/Alcatel-Lucent 8661 server products.  These classes provide support
 *   for proprietary functionality or for external specifications that are not
 *   considered stable or mature enough to be guaranteed to work in an
 *   interoperable way with other types of LDAP servers.
 * </BLOCKQUOTE>
 * <BR>
 * Whenever possible, the server will use index information to quickly identify
 * entries matching the criteria of the associated search request.  However, if
 * the count is only determined using index information, then that count may
 * include entries that would not actually be returned to the client in the
 * course of processing that search (e.g., because the client doesn't have
 * permission to access the entry, or because it is a special "operational"
 * entry like an LDAP subentry, replication conflict entry, or soft-deleted
 * entry).  Indicating that the server should always examine candidate entries
 * will increase the length of time to obtain the matching entry count, but will
 * ensure that the count will not include entries that would not otherwise be
 * returned by that search.
 * <BR><BR>
 * Also note that this control is not compatible for use with other controls
 * that may cause only a subset of entries to be returned, including the simple
 * paged results control and the virtual list view control.  It is also not
 * compatible for use with other controls that may cause the server to return
 * more entries than those that match the search criteria, like the LDAP join
 * control.
 * <BR><BR>
 * The OID for a matching entry count request control is
 * "1.3.6.1.4.1.30221.2.5.36", and it may have a criticality of either
 * {@code true} or {@code false}.  It must include a value with the following
 * encoding:

  /**
   * Retrieves a representation of this matching entry count request control as
   * a JSON object.  The JSON object uses the following fields:
   * <UL>
   *   <LI>
   *     {@code oid} -- A mandatory string field whose value is the object
   *     identifier for this control.  For the matching entry count request
   *     control, the OID is "1.3.6.1.4.1.30221.2.5.36".
   *   </LI>
   *   <LI>
   *     {@code control-name} -- An optional string field whose value is a
   *     human-readable name for this control.  This field is only intended for
   *     descriptive purposes, and when decoding a control, the {@code oid}
   *     field should be used to identify the type of control.
   *   </LI>
   *   <LI>
   *     {@code criticality} -- A mandatory Boolean field used to indicate
   *     whether this control is considered critical.
   *   </LI>
   *   <LI>
   *     {@code value-base64} -- An optional string field whose value is a
   *     base64-encoded representation of the raw value for this matching entry
   *     count request control.  Exactly one of the {@code value-base64} and
   *     {@code value-json} fields must be present.
   *   </LI>
   *   <LI>
   *     {@code value-json} -- An optional JSON object field whose value is a
   *     user-friendly representation of the value for this matching entry count
   *     request control.  Exactly one of the {@code value-base64} and
   *     {@code value-json} fields must be present, and if the
   *     {@code value-json} field is used, then it will use the following
   *     fields:
   *     <UL>
   *       <LI>
   *         {@code maximum-candidates-to-examine} -- An optional integer field
   *         whose value indicates the maximum number of entries that the server
   *         should retrieve and examine to determine whether they actually
   *         match the search criteria and would be returned to the client.
   *       </LI>
   *       <LI>
   *         {@code always-examine-candidates} -- An optional Boolean field that
   *         indicates whether the server should always examine candidates to
   *         determine whether they would actually be returned to the client,
   *         even if the search is fully indexed and the server knows that all
   *         candidates match the search criteria.
   *       </LI>
   *       <LI>
   *         {@code process-search-if-unindexed} -- An optional Boolean field
   *         that indicates whether the server should attempt to process the
   *         search even if the search criteria is completely unindexed.
   *       </LI>
   *       <LI>
   *         {@code include-debug-info} -- An optional Boolean field
   *         that indicates whether the server should return debug information
   *         in the response control about the processing it performed in the
   *         course of determining the matching entry count estimate.
   *       </LI>
   *       <LI>
   *         {@code skip-resolving-exploded-indexes} -- An optional Boolean
   *         field that indicates whether the server should skip the step of
   *         resolving exploded indexes in cases where the size of the ID set is
   *         known.
   *       </LI>
   *       <LI>
   *         {@code fast-short-circuit-threshold} -- An optional integer field
   *         whose value is the short-circuit threshold that the server should
   *         use for "fast" filter components.
   *       </LI>
   *       <LI>
   *         {@code slow-short-circuit-threshold} -- An optional integer field
   *         whose value is the short-circuit threshold that the server should
   *         use for "slow" filter components.
   *       </LI>
   *       <LI>
   *         {@code include-extended-response-data} -- An optional Boolean field
   *         that indicates whether the server should include extended
   *         information in the response control.
   *       </LI>
   *     </UL>
   *   </LI>
   * </UL>
   *
   * @return  A JSON object that contains a representation of this control.
