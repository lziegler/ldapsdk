/**
 * This class provides an implementation of the proxied authorization V1
 * request control, which may be used to request that the associated operation
 * be performed as if it had been requested by some other user.  It is based on
 * the specification provided in early versions of the
 * draft-weltman-ldapv3-proxy Internet Draft (this implementation is based on
 * the "-04" revision).  Later versions of the draft, and subsequently
 * <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4370.txt">RFC 4370</A>, define a second
 * version of the proxied authorization control with a different OID and
 * different value format.  This control is supported primarily for legacy
 * purposes, and it is recommended that new applications use the
 * {@link ProxiedAuthorizationV2RequestControl} instead if this version.
 * <BR><BR>
 * The value of this control includes the DN of the user as whom the operation
 * should be performed.  Note that it should be a distinguished name, and not an
 * authzId value as is used in the proxied authorization V2 control.
 * <BR><BR>
 * This control may be used in conjunction with add, delete, compare, delete,
 * extended, modify, modify DN, and search requests.  In that case, the
 * associated operation will be processed under the authority of the specified
 * authorization identity rather than the identity associated with the client
 * connection (i.e., the user as whom that connection is bound).  Note that
 * because of the inherent security risks associated with the use of the proxied
 * authorization control, most directory servers which support its use enforce
 * strict restrictions on the users that are allowed to request this control.
 * Note that while the directory server should return a
 * {@link ResultCode#AUTHORIZATION_DENIED} result for a proxied authorization V2
 * control if the requester does not have the appropriate permission to use that
 * control, this result will not necessarily be used for the same condition with
 * the proxied authorization V1 control because this result code was not defined
 * until the release of the proxied authorization V2 specification.
 * code.
 * <BR><BR>
 * There is no corresponding response control for this request control.
 * <BR><BR>
 * <H2>Example</H2>
 * The following example demonstrates the use of the proxied authorization V1
 * control to delete an entry under the authority of the user with DN
 * "uid=alternate.user,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com":
 * <PRE>
 * // Create a delete request to delete an entry.  Include the proxied
 * // authorization v1 request control in the delete request so that the
 * // delete will be processed as user
 * // "uid=alternate.user,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com" instead of the user
 * // that's actually authenticated on the connection.
 * DeleteRequest deleteRequest =
 *      new DeleteRequest("uid=test.user,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com");
 * deleteRequest.addControl(new ProxiedAuthorizationV1RequestControl(
 *      "uid=alternate.user,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com"));
 *
 * LDAPResult deleteResult;
 * try
 * {
 *   deleteResult = connection.delete(deleteRequest);
 *   // If we got here, then the delete was successful.
 * }
 * catch (LDAPException le)
 * {
 *   // The delete failed for some reason.  In addition to all of the normal
 *   // reasons a delete could fail (e.g., the entry doesn't exist, or has one
 *   // or more subordinates), proxied-authorization specific failures may
 *   // include that the authenticated user doesn't have permission to use the
 *   // proxied authorization control to impersonate the alternate user, that
 *   // the alternate user doesn't exist, or that the alternate user doesn't
 *   // have permission to perform the requested operation.
 *   deleteResult = le.toLDAPResult();
 *   ResultCode resultCode = le.getResultCode();
 *   String errorMessageFromServer = le.getDiagnosticMessage();
 * }
