/**
 * This class provides an implementation of a reusable referral connector that
 * maintains pools of connections to each of the servers accessed in the course
 * of following referrals.  Connections may be reused across multiple
 * referrals.  Note that it is important to close the connector when it is no
 * longer needed, as that will ensure that all of the connection pools that it
 * maintains will be closed.
 * <BR><BR>
 * <H2>Example</H2>
 * The following example demonstrates the process for establishing an LDAP
 * connection that will use this connector for following any referrals that are
 * encountered during processing:
 * <PRE>
 *   PooledReferralConnectorProperties properties =
 *        new PooledReferralConnectorProperties();

 *   LDAPConnectionOptions options = new LDAPConnectionOptions();
 *   options.setFollowReferrals(true);

 *             serverAddress, serverPort)
 *   {
 *     // Use the connection to perform whatever processing is needed that might
 *     // involve receiving referrals.
